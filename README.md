<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://www.linkpicture.com/q/slack_app.png)

Star‚≠ê the repo if you like what you seeüòâ.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of Create React App guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

To Register: Make any username annd email you want(It should have the @ usual regex in it), password and confirm password should be same , otherwise it raises the error!!

Working Sample Account: userx, userx@email.com, Password : 123456, Confirm password : 123456.

If you have already registered, you can loin with the same creds you gave for registration otherwise it displays the error!! Some of the functionalities are:-

#### Built a live chat app called CodeChat, where users will be able to create channels, to send messages to other users on those channels.
#### Send media files, see when other users are typing, add emojis to their messages.
#### Favorite and unfavorite channels they like or dislike, and get notifications about new messages on other channels. 

#### For deployment ,we will be using Firebase tools

* Securing our application with Firebase Rules - Realtime Database rules in database.rules.json file and Storage rules in storage.rules file 
* Deploying our chat app to the web using [Firebase Tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-tools)

The list of resources that I used for building this project are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

Major frameworks that are used in the project.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* [Semantic UI React](https://semantic-ui.com/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
